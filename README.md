    An app to build:
        news article app that aggregates from multiple free sources. it would be a hub of local, national, international, with different categories. the user would also be able to save and edit articles for future reference. user able to give own analysis and response.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
one issue that i had with building the app was figuring out how to input text and button onto screen. this was an issue because i had never worked with xcode so it was a new experience.
