        Swiping it to the left on the last tab automatically creates a new tab

        Highlighting stories and displaying them on your profile for an extended period of time
        Swiping a message to reply to it
        Holding a message down to react to it

An app idea that I would like to build:

I would like to build an app that would boost the user's productivity with features such as a to-do list for errands or assignments, a calendar for setting deadlines, and a built-in reminder system. I would make it look as minimal and clean as possible because i like minimalism. I would also provide the user with additional features such as selecting their own custom color themes, fonts, etc. This is an idea I got as I use notion on a daily basis to improve productivity, but I had to go through a learning process in order to learn how to use the app and set up the to-do list, calendar, and more. I want users to be able to get the hang of how to use my app as quickly as possible by making it very user-friendly.
